<h1>!!!!!Psam 121!!!!</h1>
<pre>
<p>A song of ascents.

I raise my eyes toward the mountains.*
From whence shall come my help?a
2
My help comes from the LORD,
the maker of heaven and earth.b
3
He will not allow your foot to slip;c
or your guardian to sleep.
4
Behold, the guardian of Israel
never slumbers nor sleeps.
5
*The LORD is your guardian;
the LORD is your shade
at your right hand.d
6
By day the sun will not strike you,
nor the moon by night.e
7
The LORD will guard you from all evil;
he will guard your soul.f
8
The LORD will guard your coming and going
both now and forever.g</p>
